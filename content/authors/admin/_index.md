Xabier's research focuses on the monitoring of natural hazards such as rockslides or floods using photogrammetric systems and advanced computer vision strategies. He has an active postdoctoral position in the Geosensor Systems Group at TU Dresden and is a collaborator of the RISKNAT group at the University of Barcelona.

His research interests range from the development of photogrammetric systems for automated rockfall monitoring (explored in his PhD Thesis) to the development of Deep Learning based strategies for metric image processing (main focus of his PostDoc).

His research is multidisciplinary and combines, on the one hand, his engineering and programming skills and, on the other hand, his extensive knowledge of the natural hazards analyzed. This combination allows him to develop advanced surveillance systems and AI workflows for accurate geohazards monitoring.
