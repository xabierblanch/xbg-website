Xabier's research focuses on the monitoring of natural hazards such as rockslides or floods using photogrammetric systems and advanced computer vision strategies. He has an active postdoctoral position in the Geosensor Systems Group at TU Dresden and is a collaborator of the natural hazards group RISKNAT at the University of Barcelona.

His research interests range from the development of autonomous photogrammetric systems for deformation and landslide monitoring (explored in his PhD thesis) to the development of Machine Learning or Deep Learning based strategies for image processing to obtain accurate metric values (the focus of his postdoc).

His research is multidisciplinary and combines, on the one hand, his engineering and programming skills and, on the other hand, his extensive knowledge of the natural hazards studied. This combination allows him to develop advanced surveillance systems and AI workflows for accurate geohazards monitoring.
