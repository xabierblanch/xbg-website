abstract: "Photogrammetric models have become a standard tool for the study of
  surfaces, structures and natural elements. As an alternative to Light
  Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), photogrammetry allows 3D point clouds to be
  obtained at a much lower cost. This paper presents an enhanced workflow for
  image-based 3D reconstruction of high-resolution models designed to work with
  fixed time-lapse camera systems, based on multi-epoch multi-images (MEMI) to
  exploit redundancy. This workflow is part of a fully automatic working setup
  that includes all steps: from capturing the images to obtaining clusters from
  change detection. The workflow is capable of obtaining photogrammetric models
  with a higher quality than the classic Structure from Motion (SfM) time-lapse
  photogrammetry workflow. The MEMI workflow reduced the error up to a factor of
  2 when compared to the previous approach, allowing for M3C2 standard deviation
  of 1.5 cm. In terms of absolute accuracy, using LiDAR data as a reference, our
  proposed method is 20% more accurate than models obtained with the classic
  workflow. The automation of the method as well as the improvement of the
  quality of the 3D reconstructed models enables accurate 4D photogrammetric
  analysis in near-real time."
